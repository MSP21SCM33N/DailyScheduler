## What is Angular?

Angular is a structured framework that empowers developers to build fully scalable applications that live on the web, mobile or desktop. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.

In this project we will build a simple application to demonstrate core Angular features:

* Add and remove from a list
* Two-way data binding on a form
* Drag and drop elements on a list \(available in Angular 7 and Angular Material 7\)
