# Learn Angular

Why learn Angular?

Angular is a structured framework used to build dynamic enterprise scale applications. It creates a single page application that allows user interactions to be dynamically displayed without the need to refresh the application.

In this project we will build a simple application to demonstrate core Angular theories

* Add and remove from a list
* Two-way data binding on a form
* Drag and drop elements on a list \(available in Angular 7 and Angular Material 7\)
